# Profile Page Exercise

You are going to build your personal profile page!!!!!
It is not mandatory to copy this one, you can just use it as a reference for the necessary sections and be as creative as you can.

Sections to be implemented:
* Header: 
  * Your name.
  * A title that describes your development stack: front end, full stack or back end.
  * Links to other sections.
* Biography: Some words about you, like an universal cover letter. It is also nice to explain in here your reasons to do a bootcamp.
* Portfolio: In here you will show those projects that you are more proud of. It is also good to show other projects that you are working on or you have the intention, explaining your next steps.
* Contact: With links to your different social accounts, and also other information like your cv, telephone number or email.
